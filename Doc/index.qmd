abstract: |
    We study the impact of generative AI on productivity in Canada. Using production functions and firm-level data on Canadian firms, we aim to measure if there had been any productivity gains from the adoption of generative AI. The main challenge of identifying a causal effect of generative AI on productivity is that more productive firms may be more likely to adopt AI technologies. By modeling the firms' decision to adopt AI and leveraging from linking different datasets, we propose a clear identification strategy.
